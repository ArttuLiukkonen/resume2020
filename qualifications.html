											<h2>Business Case Competition</h2>
										<h3><i>Technological University Dublin</i></h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/dublin.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>I had a Business Case Consulting Training course in the autumn period of 2019 and
											got selected to represent my school in a business case competition in Dublin.
											There, we were presented with problems real companies
											were facing and it was our task to propose our solutions to them. During that intense study week,
											I improved my presentation skills massively, learned a lot about presentations in a
											multicultural setting and saw what consulting as a career might look like.</p>

											<h2>This website</h2>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/github.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											I built this website entirely on my own as a project I had had in my mind for a while. With minimum
											coding knowledge prior to this project, I was able to build fully functional website with the help of
											a html5 template and tutorial videos. I could have used website builders like Wix or WordPress, but
											I felt those would have restricted me too much on the creative aspects of the website. By building
											the website from code, I also learned the basics of html5 code, how to publish a website using GitHub and
											how to push changes to your website with Git. <br><br>

											Every photo on this website is my own, except company logos. I figured I might as well showcase my photography
											work rather than use stock photos from the internet.

											<h2>Cesim Global Challenge, <i>1st place</i></h2>
											<h3><i>International Business and Strategy Management Simulation Game</i></h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/gclogo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Cesim Global Challenge is a business simulation game where you and your team run a company
											and it is up to you how well you will do. The game has many of the same elements as there are
											in real life: market outlook, R&D, production, logistics, marketing, HR, taxation and future investments.
											The nature of the game was very competitive since you were against your classmates but in the end, my team was
											able to come out on top largely due to our clear strategy we executed from the beginning. The game taught me a lot about
											causal connections and that thorough planning pays off!

												<h2>General photography- and photo editing experience</h2>
											</header>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/sotilas.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>I bought my first DSLR camera in 2015 and have been an enthusiastic photographer ever
											 	since. At first, I was doing it just for my personal enjoyment since I found
												it very satisfying to capture scenic pictures.
												Soon after I started getting job offers from my relatives to be the
												cameraman of their important event which further improved and diversified my photography
												skills.<br><br>
												I started my military service in the summer of 2017 and there, I wanted to become
												a cameraman since I figured it might help me in the future if I decide to pursue
												photography as a career. My wishes came true and I became a photographer for
												Lapland's Military Band in Rovaniemi. In the beginning of my training, I completed Finnish Defence Forces'
												five-day photography course in Tuusula after which I became a certified photographer.
												The course further improved my skills in the fields of sports-, staged-, action- and low-light
												photography.<br><br>
												After the course in Tuusula, I returned to Rovaniemi where I created marketing material
												for the band's future concerts, toured with them all over
												Northern Lapland photographing their concerts and published content such as photos, interviews
												and compilation videos to their
												social media.<br><br>
												After completing my military service in the spring of 2018, I worked for the city of Jämsä for one month as a social media
												content creator. I got the job largely due to my merits in the military earlier the same year. I continued from where I
												had left off in the military, only the people in my photos had changed from musicians to everyday people.
